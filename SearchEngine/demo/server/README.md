# Getting Started with Search Engine Demo Server

This is only the server of the demo, make sure you follow the steps in the demo readme file.

## How its made?

If you are curious what we used to create this mini server we use :

- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) : HTTP simple server for python
- [PyMongo](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) : Mongo adapter for python
